# Car Rental System

## Overview
This Car Rental System is a Java-based application developed as part of the BSD 214 Object-Oriented Programming 2 course. It demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to create a simple yet functional car rental management system.

## Features
- Add and display available cars
- Register new customers
- Rent a car to a customer
- Display car and customer details

## Classes
1. `Car`: Represents a car with model, brand, and price per day.
2. `Customer`: Represents a customer with name, age, and license number.
3. `RentalAgency`: Manages the fleet of cars and rental operations.
4. `CarRentalSystem`: Main class that runs the program and handles user interaction.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Compile the Java files:
   ```
   javac CarRentalSystem.java
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```
   java CarRentalSystem
   ```

## Usage
1. When you run the program, it will display the available cars in the rental agency.
2. You will be prompted to enter customer details (name, age, license number).
3. Choose a car to rent by entering its number.
4. The program will display the chosen car's details and confirm the rental.

## Future Improvements
- Implement error handling and input validation
- Add functionality to return rented cars
- Include rental duration and cost calculation
- Implement data persistence (file or database storage)
- Expand the user interface with more options and a menu system
